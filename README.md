"I went through hell," says Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother and peace activist released by Hamas on Monday after two weeks in captivity.

Ms Lifschitz and her husband were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen on motorbikes and taken into a "spider's web" of tunnels underneath Gaza, she said.

She described being hit by sticks on the journey, but said most of the hostages were being "treated well".

She was freed alongside another woman, Nurit Cooper, 79, on Monday evening.Gao Yaojie, a renowned dissident doctor who exposed the Aids epidemic in rural China, has died aged 95.

Dr Gao died of natural causes in New York, where she had been in exile since 2009, a friend of hers told the BBC.


She was at the forefront of Aids activism in China and travelled across the country treating patients, often at her own expense.

Born in Shandong province in1927, Dr Gao was a gynaecologist by training. She encountered her first AIDS patient in the central province of Henan in 1996.

At that time, Chinese authorities were saying that HIV could be transmitted in two ways - through sex or from mother-to-child during pregnancy. Dr Gao had a realisation when she found that one of her patients did not fall into either category but had a history of blood transfusion.

Extraordinary images show the grandmother shaking the hand of a Hamas gunman, just seconds before she was handed over to the International Red Cross at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and neighbouring Egypt.

"Shalom," she appears to say to the gunman - the Hebrew word for peace.

Ms Lifschitz was kidnapped, alongside her husband Oded, from Nir Oz Kibbutz in southern Israel on 7 October. He has not been released.

It was early in the morning when Hamas attacked their kibbutz, massacring the small community. One in four residents are believed to have been killed or kidnapped, including many children.

Speaking at a news conference from Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv just a few hours after her release, Ms Lifschitz explained what happened after she was kidnapped.

She said she was hit with sticks during the journey into Gaza, and suffered bruises and breathing difficulties.
